It is a great way of meeting new people in a safe environment and enjoying the \u2018natural buzz\u2019 that this wonderful sport can give. Also, it is a way of relieving some of the stresses that substance misuse can place upon an individual, and one of the main benefits is that participants release natural endorphins (which especially heroin, blocks the brain receptors to).\n\nWe play every Monday afternoon at Wolverhampton University Sports Hall facility, as well as entering local tournaments. We hope to join a league soon.\n\nRecently, local charity Wolves Aid donated Wolverhampton Wanderers football kit for us to play in. So thank you Rachel and Barbara from Wolves Aid.\n\nIf you live in Wolverhampton and are interested in joining our team, then call Patrick on (01902 328983), or text SUIT Football to 88010 (standard network charges apply).",

This may include signposting to other organisations, helping to check that a client is claiming all the benefits they are entitled to, help with form filling etc. \n\nPlease be aware and prepared that the food bank volunteers will also offer to pray for people's situations since the food bank is facilitated by a church community.

By smelling it, tasting it and visually inspecting it.\n\nWe do not turn food away simply because it has expired. But we will never serve food that we believe is unfit for human consumption. \n\nWe operate on a Pay as You Feel basis. Please bring your own bags!\n\nWhat do we mean by PAYF?\n\nPAYF (Pay As You Feel) offers an alternative to the conventional payment system as there are no prices on any produce in the caf&eacute;s or supermarkets. Our system transcends monetary transactions and liberates people to use their skills and attributes as well as money to pay for their meals.\n\nFurthermore, we aim to highlight the absurdity that the produce we use has been stripped of it\u2019s monetary value but still retains it\u2019s nutritional value. by making people think about what they wish to contribute for their meals, that idea is to get Society thinking about how they value food as a resource",

Civil claims could be made against an individual who has committed abuse, an organisation responsible for that person (usually an employer) or an organisation that should have taken steps to prevent abuse, but failed - such as social services.\n\nAn Irwin Mitchell solicitor provides free advice alongside emotional and practical support from a member of our advocacy team.\n\nThe legal clinics are generally on the last Friday of every month between 11:00am and 1:00pm\n\nIf you would like to access this service but cannot attend the scheduled session, please contact the advocacy (ISVA) team on 0121 643 0301 option 2 or isva@rsvporg.co.uk and we will look into accommodating your enquiry at a more convenient time for you.",

      "description": "Home-Start - Support for parents and families\nBeing a parent has never been easy. It can be lonely, frustrating, heart breaking and over-whelming. \nAll parents struggle at one time or another. You are not alone.\nHome-Start\u2019s expert staff and trained volunteers work alongside families just like yours to give non-judgmental, compassionate and confidential support.\nThey help you regain confidence and be the parent you want to be. Below are some of the areas we can help with.\nA volunteer to support you \nHome-Start volunteers understand how hard it can be to be a parent. They work alongside parents, usually in their own homes, to help them cope with the stresses and strains of life and make sure they have the skills, confidence and strength they need to nurture their children.\n\nGroup support \nMany Home-Starts run specialist groups to provide further support, and social connection, for parents. They may also run groups for babies and children so that they can play together, while also giving parents a chance to meet others going through the same kind of experience.\n\nParental mental health and perinatal illness \nMore than a third of parents we support ask for our help to cope with perinatal illness, their own or their child's mental ill-health.\n\nMoney issues \nWe help families with organising their money if they find it overwhelming or if it's hard to make ends meet.\n\nWhen a relationship ends \nIf you are trying to cope after a separation, divorce, or after leaving an abusive relationship...\n\nIf you think that you could benefit from the support of a Home-Start volunteer then you can get in touch with your local Home-Start yourself\nOther people may be referred to their local Home-Start by a health visitor, doctor or other professional.",

We visit people regularly, so that you have someone to talk to and can get a helping hand when you need it.\n\nOur befrienders can come and sit and chat over a cup of tea, or maybe take up a hobby you enjoy, or accompany you out for a walk or to get to an appointment. We can also help with sorting through post or making phone calls.\n\nAlongside this we also arrange regular social activities in the community, giving you chance to get out and connect with others. From our Time for Tea afternoon teas, held bi-monthly at Queen Alexandra College in Harborne, and our weekly Senior Life Group, held at Oasis Church in Harborne on Tuesdays, to coffee afternoons, trips out and Christmas parties. We also run a weekly Art Group which takes place every two weeks at our main office in Ladywood. It\u2019s a relaxed and friendly environment led by one of our experienced volunteers.\n\nWe want you to feel connected and supported and encouraged to continue to flourish later in life.\n\nFor more information on any of the activities, or befriending, please contact Helen or Patti on 0121 455 7524 or e-mail helen.bell@karisneighbourscheme.org.",

However we have developed the service to offer a blended mix of virtual activities and face to face support sessions.\n\nSupport is available via face-to-face sessions in the Hubs, online sessions, but also via private peer social media groups and outdoor sessions (using parks & garden space).\n\nThis integrated service allows service users to move freely across all 4 locations, with the opportunity to choose from support sessions available on each Hub timetable.\n\nOnline Referrals and current timetables are accessible via the service website\n\nWe accept referrals from all parties, including GP\u2019s, CMHT\u2019s and self-referrals.\nPlease complete the referral form via the website\n\nThe manager of the Handsworth Hub is David Tresize",

Our advisors are trained and experienced. We understand that debt can be stressful and difficult.\n\nWe have a free caf&eacute; running alongside our Money Advice drop-ins during school term times.\n\nOur service differs from Citizens Advice and phone-based advice services - we will meet you face-to-face, and as we work together we will keep meeting with you from that first appointment, right through until everything is sorted, no matter how long it takes. While you still want to get out of debt or get your money issues sorted, we\u2019ll keep helping.",

      "description": "Our objective is to provide a range of advice and guidance to anyone who needs help. This is done by helping clients directly through our team of advisers. Through their intervention, clients obtain better services, benefits and grants of which they may have been unaware and to which they are entitled.\n\nClients faced with creditors or being evicted are helped by interventions to mitigate these conditions. Budgeting of a client\u2019s overall income and expenditure and then helping to put in place regular payment plans to creditors, is frequently part of the work. In more difficult cases for those clients with significant debt, help can be given to establish a Debt Relief Order (DRO).\n\nAll Narthex advisers are appropriately qualified and have gained considerable experience in bringing positive outcomes to the situations presented by clients. The team of advisers has been expanded in 2021 and demand for its services is still growing. All consultations are conducted on the telephone or online. If you need support in any way please call Sandra on 07467 045294 Monday to Friday or email sandra1@narthex.org.uk as we are not open for face-to-face consultations at present.",

Because of their sexuality, gender identity, gender expression or intersex status they often:\nare abused in refugee accommodation by other refugees who often come from the same countries they are escaping from\nbecome homeless and depressed\nare rejected by their ethnic community and live in poverty\n\nWhat we are doing to help LGBTQI asylum seekers and refugees\n\nMicro Rainbow opened the first safe house in the United Kingdom dedicated solely to LGBTQI asylum seekers and refugees. Our houses provide a safe and temporary shelter for all LGBTQI asylum seekers and refugees.

Birthday celebrations allow us to acknowledge those in our lives who are important to us and celebrate the gift of their lives.\n\nWhen a child\u2019s birthday approaches, some parents often get excited and prepare in advance to celebrate the occasion. But for some families it can be a difficult time of year. For Children living in extreme poverty rarely get to celebrate their birthdays. \n\nWe at New Beginnings Community believe that every child deserves to feel special and celebrated on their birthday.\n\nThe Birthday Project provides children in need (up to the age of 11) with a \u2018Birthday-In-A-Bag\u2019 to ensure they do not go without on this special occasions. Each pack contains at least 2 presents, chocolates, or sweets, wrapping paper, sellotape, a birthday card, and party decorations. Other items that may be included are party hats, badges, cake mix, frosting and candles depending on supplies\n\nReferrals are made via the help of health professionals, local food banks, community navigators, faith groups, who work directly with these families. Our Birthday Project volunteers then lovingly collect sort and package a \u2018Birthday-In-A-Bag\u2019 for the child based on the child\u2019s age and interests. These are then collected by the referral agent and delivered to the parent of the child hopefully about a month before the child\u2019s birthday.\n\nMost of the contents of our packs will be donated by our generous community who already donate toys to New Beginnings Community on a regular basis.\n\nFor more details or to refer into the service, please email thebirthdayproject@newbeginningscommunity.co.uk \nYou can also visit our Birthday Project Facebook page",

The founder members worked together with Marie Curie hospice, and the Men\u2019s Shed group is now very well-established and growing. Money was raised to purchase a large, free-standing, purpose built shed which was erected in 2020 in the hospice grounds surrounded by our beautiful gardens.\n\nThe Men\u2019s Shed offers an environment where men of all ages can get together for support and companionship. It is a \u2018drop in\u2019 group run by experienced volunteers. Each session lasts approximately 2.5 hours and group size varies but is usually around 10-15. The programme includes a variety of activities, including games, art therapy, speakers and outings.\n\nThe supportive environment created in the Shed is a safe space for men to not only socialise with camaraderie but also to talk about their troubles if they choose to - without any pressure.\n\nNew members welcome!\n\nFor further information please contact:\n\nT: 0121 703 3600 - E: lisa.shyamalan@mariecurie.org.uk\n\nMen\u2019s Sheds are kitted out community spaces where men can enjoy practical hobbies.\n\nThey\u2019re about making friends, learning and sharing skills. Many guys come just for the tea and banter - everyone\u2019s welcome.\n\nWM Postive Pathways: Universal Prevention & Move On Support",

The client is always in control and the plan developed will always be determined by the needs and abilities of the client themselves, this way a successful outcome is achievable and the possibility of future sustainability is stronger.\n\nOur aim is to gain trust with our clients to help them develop the skills and confidence needed to regain control over the possessions that have overwhelmed them. We like to work with support workers or carers that may be involved with the individual\u2019s progression.\n\nWe work with private individuals, social landlords, housing associations and any service who may work with people with hoarding disorder.\n\nWe also have support groups, online and physical (https://www.cloudsend.org.uk/hoarding-support-services/support-groups/) where we meet twice monthly. We offer support and understanding to anyone affected by hoarding, discussion of useful tactics for reducing belongings. There will be tea and biscuits!",

      "description": "Chaos 2 Order helping agencies in the city better understand hoarding behaviour in their citizens.\n\nSince 2019 Clouds End CIC has been working with Birmingham City Council\u2019s Preventions and Communities department to help agencies in the city better understand hoarding behaviour in their citizens.\n\nHoarding affects 2-5% of the population. Understanding why people hoard helps us to work in a supportive and compassionate way. This produces better results and engagement - which ultimately saves time, money and pain.\n\nThe aim of this project is to better educate and upskill the agencies who encounter hoarding behaviour and help them integrate that understanding into their everyday procedures.\n\nHeather Matuozzo of Clouds End offers mixed-agency training sessions online.\n\nDates can be found on the website\nPlease contact Maz.Williams@birmingham.gov.uk to book a place.\n\nHeather will also upskill through mixed-agency huddles on Zoom for 2022, again, dates are listed on the website.\nPlease contact Heather at help@cloudsend.org.uk for places on these huddles.\n\nAdult Social Care is also working with Heather to provide mentoring for student social workers who have expressed an interest in specialising in hoarding behaviour during their work placements. Places are limited but contact adulthoarding@birmignham.gov.uk for availability.\n\nThere is also a limited amount of funding to help with extras services such as clearing, cleaning and one-to-one work but this can only be applied for after agencies have used their usual funds to address these issues. This will be checked on the referral form. There is a waiting list for extra services and citizens have to consent to be part of the project to access them. They must also agree to a visit including an interview about how the intervention helped them.\n\nContact Heather at help@cloudsend.org.uk for a referral form.\n\nThe aim of Chaos 2 Order project is to make Birmingham the first Hoarding Aware City in the world. We do hope that everyone will join in with the spirit of this through the Hoarding Charter. Ask about this on the help@cloudsend.org.uk email also.",

      "description": "Community Essentials Foodbank \nWe provide individuals and families a minimum of 3 days of meals. Our emergency food parcels are not designed to meet long-term needs. Therefore, we also try to provide additional support, such as debt advice, where possible. When available we also supply toiletries and hygiene products upon request. Please ask when collecting.\n\nHow to apply\nVisit our booking form on our website and choose a day and time to suit you. Once the form on the website has been submitted, you will receive an email and text confirming we have received your request. Our team will then get to work to confirm your request to collect your food parcel at the time you chose as soon as possible. Once it has been confirmed you will receive another email and text to let you know it is confirmed, then you can come and collect your parcel at your chosen time. If there is any issues with the time you selected, our team will contact you to see if we can find an alternative suitable time. The confirmation email and text will also receive a link to Google Maps so you can find us.\n\nPetfood Bank\n\nNo pet should have to go hungry. And no one should have to choose between feeding themselves or feeding their pets. Hard times can happen to anyone, and with pets in the family there are more bowls to fill when money is tight.\n\nAnd thats why we have partnered with Pets at Home Solihull and Blue Cross to provide a Pet Food Bank to our community. Anyone struggling to feed their pets can get help from our pet food bank. We understand that coming to a food bank can be difficult. We won\u2019t ask you for a voucher or proof of need, and our team will welcome you without judgement.\n\nHow to apply for help with pet food \nEasy, simply fill in a food parcel request form referred to above, and mention in the additional Information box on the form that you need pet food, and what you need. Because we rely on donations, we can\u2019t guarantee we\u2019ll have stock for all pets at all times, so it may be best to reach out to us prior to check if we have what you need",

      "description": "Caldmore Community\u2019s Gardens\u2019 Men\u2019s Shed project aims to create a regular meeting space for men in the environs of Caldmore Community Garden in Walsall, where they can develop ideas and collaborative projects through regular meetings and activity sessions.\n\nAs a group we have been meeting since October 2016 and already we have built a shed and have kitted it out with a wood burning stove, lighting and other improvements to make it a place to work and socialise together. We have adopted a raised growing bed in Caldmore Community Garden which we have been cultivating for a while. We have also worked together to construct a wood burning stove, built a tree house, added a playhouse to our children playground and are now learning how to build wooden planters to raise some funds for future projects.\n\nAlong the way we have a lot of fun and drink loads of coffee and tea. Every session starts with coffee and croissants!\n\nCaldmore Men\u2019s Shed is for you!\nWe are an easy-going group who always welcome new people. You don\u2019t have to have any previous experience of doing anything practical or of getting involved in groups. When we take on projects we plan and do them together learning from each other. Most importantly it\u2019s free to join! All we ask is that you come and give up a little of your time and get involved. Its open to men of all ages, cultures and backgrounds.\n\nWe meet every Monday between 10.00 am and 12.30 pm. Every session starts with a sit down and a cup of coffee while they plan their morning together.\n\nContact: Stephen Breeze for more information\n\nT: 07970 856148 / E: caldmoregarden@gmail.com",
